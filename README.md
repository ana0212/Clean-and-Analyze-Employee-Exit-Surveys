# Clean-and-Analyze-Employee-Exit-Surveys

- In this project, we cleaned and analyzed exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training, and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) of Queensland in Australia.
- Our goal was to identify the dissatisfaction of the employees who exit, the ones who worked for a short period, and the ones that stayed longer.
- In the Exploratory Data Analysis section, we analyzed the percentages of dissatisfaction of ex-employees according to the time of service, age, gender, and employment status. Besides that, we also analyzed the age, gender, and employment status of each career stage category. We noticed that the profiles of dissatisfied employees were different accordingly to the years of service, and the actions to minimize job dissatisfaction must be suitable to each category.
